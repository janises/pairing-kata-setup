/** Write a function that converts Roman numbers into Arabic numbers and throws an error if the Roman number is in an invalid form. */

/** Rules
 * 1. Repeating a number up to three times adds that value three times. e.g., III = 3
 * 2. A Roman ‘digit’ can’t repeat more than three times.  Instead the previous 1, 10, or 100 equivalent value is used to subtract from the next ‘digit’.
 * 3. With the exception of the subtraction rule above, all values must decrease in scale from left to right and are added together.
 * I = 1
 * V = 5
 * X = 10
 * L = 50
 * C = 100
 * D = 500
 * M = 1000
 * 
 * Examples:
 * III = 3
 * IIII is invalid
 * IV = 4
 * VIII = 8
